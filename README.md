# lctree
Rust implementation of [Link-cut tree](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/800076.802464): self-balancing data structure to maintain a dynamic forest of (un)rooted trees under the following operations that take `O(logn)` amortized time:
* `link(v, w)`: creates an edge between nodes `v` and `w`.
* `cut(v, w)`: removes the edge between nodes `v` and `w`.
* `connected(v, w)`: returns `true` if nodes `v` and `w` are in the same tree.
* `path(v, w)`: performs calculations on a path between nodes `v` and `w`.

## Usage
This example shows how to link and cut edges:
```rust
use lctree::LinkCutTree;

fn main() {
    // We form a link-cut tree from the following rooted tree:
    //     a
    //    / \
    //   b   e
    //  / \   \
    // c   d   f
    let mut lctree = lctree::LinkCutTree::default();
    let a = lctree.make_tree(0.0);
    let b = lctree.make_tree(1.0);
    let c = lctree.make_tree(2.0);
    let d = lctree.make_tree(3.0);
    let e = lctree.make_tree(4.0);
    let f = lctree.make_tree(5.0);
    lctree.link(b, a);
    lctree.link(c, b);
    lctree.link(d, b);
    lctree.link(e, a);
    lctree.link(f, e);

    // Checking connectivity:
    assert!(lctree.connected(c, f)); // connected

    // We cut node e from its parent a:
    lctree.cut(e, a);

    // The forest should now look like this:
    //     a
    //    / 
    //   b     e
    //  / \     \
    // c   d     f

    // We check connectivity again:
    assert!(!lctree.connected(c, f)); // not connected anymore
}
```
Advanced usage include operations on paths:

<summary>Common path aggregates</summary>

Various kinds of calculations can be performed on a path between two nodes, provided as `findmax`, `findmin`, or `findsum`:

```rust
use lctree::{LinkCutTree, FindMax, FindMin, FindSum};

fn main() {
    // We form a link-cut tree from the following rooted tree
    // (the numbers in parentheses are the weights of the nodes):
    //           a(9)
    //           /  \
    //         b(1)  e(2)
    //        /   \    \
    //      c(8)  d(0)  f(4)

    // Replace FindMax with FindMin or FindSum, depending on your usage:
    let mut lctree: LinkCutTree<FindMax> = lctree::LinkCutTree::new();
    let a = lctree.make_tree(9.);
    let b = lctree.make_tree(1.);
    let c = lctree.make_tree(8.);
    let d = lctree.make_tree(0.);
    let e = lctree.make_tree(2.);
    let f = lctree.make_tree(4.);

    lctree.link(b, a);
    lctree.link(c, b);
    lctree.link(d, b);
    lctree.link(e, a);
    lctree.link(f, e);

    // We find the node with max weight on the path between c to f,
    // where a has the maximum weight of 9.0:
    let heaviest_node = lctree.path(c, f);
    assert_eq!(heaviest_node.idx, a);
    assert_eq!(heaviest_node.weight, 9.0);
}
```

<details>
<summary>Custom path aggregate function</summary>
    
A custom path aggregate function can be defined by using the `Path` trait:
    
```rust
use lctree::{LinkCutTree, Path};

#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct FindXor {
    pub xor: u64,
}

impl Path for FindXor {
    fn default(weight: f64, _: usize) -> Self {
        FindXor {
            xor: weight as u64,
        }
    }

    fn aggregate(&mut self, other: Self) {
        self.xor ^= other.xor;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut lctree: LinkCutTree<FindXor> = LinkCutTree::new();
    ...
}
```

</details>

## Benchmark
The overall running time for performing a number of random operations (`link(v, w)`, `cut(v, w)`, `connected(v, w)` or `findmax(v, w)`) on forests of varying sizes (check benchmark details [here](https://github.com/azizkayumov/lctree/blob/main/benches/README.md)).
